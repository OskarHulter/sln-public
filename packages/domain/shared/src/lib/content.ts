    I'm an INTPJ. I definitely have an analytical mindset.This is reflected in my three biggest interests: music, strategy games & programming.
    As with any personality trait, an analytical mindset brings both pros and cons.

    I really enjoy the process of learning, working on my craft, experiencing new realizations and the fulfillment of solving problems efficiently.
    My primary challenge is that I am susceptible to analysis paralysis. I try to remedy this by acknowledging that no solution has to be perfect from the start. Even if you start building something that isn't the most efficient solution, you'll learn the correct requirements in the process.

    However, my curiosity is not limited to the technical realm.
      I am interested in systems thinking in the broadest sense, covering topics like business processes and understanding customer needs. My thoughts on these topics are mostly influenced by the lean methodology. I studied lean during my time at LTU and it deeply resonates with my personal core values. The lean principles are all important tools in my tool belt that I find useful in many different areas.

      The art of writing clean code that is concise, consistent, elegant and readable is a fulfilling challenge that I try to get better at each day.
      I would love to apply & learn more about machine learning in the long term.
